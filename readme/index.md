CS583: Deep Learning
============


> Instructor: Shusen Wang




Read this before taking the course!
---------

The course requires heavy workload. Do NOT take this course unless you can spend much time on this course.

- You are required (instead of "recommended") to read the text book, "Deep learning with Python", and run the example code. In the quizzes and final exam, there will be questions based on the book's content, especially the content not covered in the class.

- There are at least 5 homework.

- There are additional programming assignment, by doing which you will receive bonus score. Get "A" is difficult without collecting the bonus.

- In the 2nd class, you will be asked to do a quiz (weight in the grading: around 5\%). The quiz will test your knowledge in elementary algebra and calculus and Python programming (especially NumPy).

- There will be a quiz on matrix algebra, matrix calculus, and optimization.

- In the final exam, there will be questions on matrix algebra, differentiation, optimization, and Python code understanding.



Before the class begins, get yourself well prepared by:

- Reading a few chapters of the textbook, *"Deep learning with Python"*, and running the sample code.

- Reading a few chapters of the book, *"Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra"*.
